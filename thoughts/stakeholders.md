# Questions from different stakeholders

## From Engineering

- How is user activity modeled as data?
- What are the matching algorithms? Heuristics or ML?
- What data privacy principles are in place if inference is a goal?

## From Product

- Who’s the first user? What behavior change do you expect from them?
- What are the success metrics for a connection?
- How do we validate “inferred compatibility”?

## From Design

- How do we balance openness vs. overload on the roadmap?
- Is the user experience consistent between matched pairs?
- How do we handle mismatches or drop-offs mid-roadmap?
