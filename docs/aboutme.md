Design is fundamental to my interest in product thinking, especially when examined through first principles. I often think of design like an onion; each layer represents a contract, and as you peel them away, you uncover the core of the original system: its purpose and the mental model it offers the user. How can this system be both extensible and expressive without becoming fragile? If we restructure this API or contract, what will the implications be for someone who didn’t design it? What is the relationship between this model and the next?

For me, design is not just about click trees or deciding which visual style should be applied to a button or single-page application (SPA) to make it appealing. It’s about the modular representation of a contract, where components are wrapped with intent. When you look at Vue's Single File Components (SFC), you glimpse what I mean. Every detail of the code, whether discrete or not, evolves with this intent, transitioning from affordances to a conceptual image. I constantly ask what should be removed for simplicity and clarity, and what must be added for better understanding.

Behind the scenes, the design intent must align with the business logic and directly connect with how users interact with the application or product. If you peel the onion further, you’ll realise that the code is, in fact, the product, and users are the developers who must evaluate the relevance of this intent to the business logic.

I often break this down into affordance blocks and wireframe each block to its respective layer; sometimes the intent is obvious from the onset, while at other times it may be vague. This is what design means to me. My approach involves observation—using no code, no complex settings, just a pen and paper, and thoughtful consideration of how intent should be conveyed to the user with the tools available to me.

## Roles Interested In

- Product Engineering [ FullStack | | Systems-oriented ]
- Platform | | Infra Engineer  [ blends infra with DX: building APIs, tooling, event-driven infra ]
- DX | | Internal Tooling Engineer [ where DX overlaps with systems - CLI tools, infra platforms, codegen ]

## My Preferred Stack

These are fallbacks, not explicit, just tools that help me achieve intent.

- Languages:
  - Go [ for systems, performance, APIs, microservices, Infra]
  - Python [ RHIA: inference engine: REL, Models, etc., ]
  - Prolog [ RHIA: understanding backward chaining, logic + reasoning, expert systems ]
  - Typescript [ Frontend with Vue + Pinia ]

- Infra:
  - PostgreSQL + SQLC [ typed data layer ]
  - gRPC + protobuf [ contract-first API design ]
  - Terraform + AWS [ IaC, cloud native, serverless ]
  - Kubernetes [ Kind: not often, more playground ]

- Frontend:
  - Vue3 + Pinia
  - Vanilla CSS [ TailwindCSS gives me a headache ]
  - UX [ strong focus on affordances, clean UI, concetual images ]
