It’s not a social feed or a dating app — it’s a system for structured support. \nThrough intent-based UX, and shared roadmaps, buddy.me pairs users based on aligned effort, not algorithmic guesswork. \nThe platform is being built with a strong focus on clean architecture, modular design systems, and a principled UX \nphilosophy that prioritizes clarity, and mutuality — ideal for devs and designers who care deeply about experience, \nsemantics, and systems that serve real human needs.",
