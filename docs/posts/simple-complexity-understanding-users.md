# Understanding Users: Simple vs. Complex

I'll start with a simple question: **"What do you want to show the user?"** Now compare it to this one: **"What does the user want to see?"**

The first question imposes our will onto the user — it reflects what *we* care about. The second centers the user's desires — what *they* care about.

The challenge is moving from the first to the second.

But how do we get there? We begin by anchoring ourselves in **the users goal** as it relates to the product we are building. That alone unlocks a deeper layer of inquiry:

1. What is the purpose of the product?
2. What is the goal of the user?
3. Why should the user care?

When **question 1 = question 2**, we have found alignment. And that alignment is the root of intuitive design and meaningful product behavior.

## A Physical Thought Experiment: The Bowl

To understand this better, lets leave the digital world for a second and talk about something simple, a physical product: a bowl.

In most use cases our first instinct as designers is to ask: **How do we make it look good? What would make it sell?**. And sure, aesthetics and marketability are important — but they're not where design begins. Design begins with a question.

If we apply this question — *What does the user want to see?* — to a bowl, things get interesting. We open up a whole spectrum of use cases and contexts, most of which are invisible to the designer at first glance.

### What’s the user’s goal?

- Is it for holding cereal?  
- Serving soup?  
- Mixing ingredients?  
- Displaying fruit?

> Look deeper into these questions and you'd notice that these are sub-goals, you can actually use something else to display fruits and serve soup, etc.

And beyond purpose, what about **material**? - Wood vs. plastic vs. glass vs. aluminium? Each material offers a different *feel*, *weight*, *temperature*, and even *sound*.

By simply asking what the **user wants to do**, we unlock meaningful distinctions: Why a chef might prefer a metal bowl, while a minimalist prefers matte ceramic. Why a child might need a bowl that won’t break. Why someone eating alone might care more about warmth than presentation.

All of this — without ever touching color, UI, or branding.

## From Purpose to Product

When we understand the user’s goal, we start designing *from the inside out*.  

That gives us clarity on:

- **What to build**  
- **How to build it**  
- **Why it should exist**  
- **Why anyone should care**

Suddenly, we’re not just adding polish — we’re making *decisions with weight*.

So at its core, **design isn’t just aesthetics**. Good design is the result of countless micro-decisions, driven by **a bi-directional relationship** between the product and the person using it. Design isn’t just how it looks. It’s how well it listens.
