# How I Built My Blog with VitePress

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...

  Hi, I’m Raeva — a systems-minded product engineer. I enjoy working across frontend, backend, cloud, and infrastructure, crafting products that feel intuitive, scalable, and human-centered. I believe the goal is to do more with less — less noise, more clarity. With a background in Physics, and knowledge of design and software engineering, I approach problems with a blend of logic, creativity, and structured reasoning. I'm currently building <ExternalLink class="links" href="/buddy" target="_self">Buddy.me</ExternalLink>, a project focused on gamifying personal progress through natural UX and solid architecture. I lean into clean systems, clear design, and architecture that speak for themselves. The core trait is affordance — the conceptual ideal behind every product decision: Why are components, contracts, and UI/UX are structured the way they are? Why render it this way, and not differently? Every nuance of code — lekker or not — must mean something. In the end, the goal is simple: to leave everything a little better than I found it. And hey! I write <ExternalLink class="links" href="/poetry" target="_self">poetry</ExternalLink> too, if that's your thing!
