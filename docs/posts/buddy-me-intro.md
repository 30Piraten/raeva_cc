## Buddy.me: What, Why, and How

> Buddy.me is not trying to solve relationship problem, neither does it claim to understand the human mind, it only wants to tackle and observe the connection between two people and build itself around it through inference.

## A New Way to Connect

We form connections daily, Mrs Johnson, Amar or Lina, meet people daily, at work, at the grocery store, or even on the bus. But a great many of this connections don't *stick*. Social media gave us followers, likes, and viral moments—but it failed to give us something simpler: someone to walk a path with.

**Buddy.me** isn’t a dating app. It isn’t a social feed. It’s a platform designed to pair two people around a shared goal—then let their paths merge.

Buddy.me's aim is not based on surface-level preferences—what color you like, what band you follow, are you a vegan or a vegetarian. That’s not connection. That’s curation. Instead, we believe in **inference**—seeing how people move through a structured journey (what I call a *roadmap*) and letting the product (*buddy.me*) learn from that movement.

> It’s like watching two people dance. You don’t need to know their past to feel whether the rhythm works. It’s all in the movement, choices, reaction.

### Why buddy.me exist

Buddy.me is built for people like:

* **Mrs. Johnson**, a new mother trying to lose weight but struggling alone.
* **Amar**, a young developer trying to stick to a learning plan.
* **Lina**, battling anxiety, seeking structure with empathy.

These people don’t need likes. They need **someone who gets it**. Someone who’s walking that same path.

### What I'm building

* A **Roadmap System**: Structured, goal-driven journeys (fitness, focus, habit, etc.).
* **Checkpoints**: At each checkpoint, Buddy.me matches you with someone on a similar journey. But not just anyone—the match is inferred based on how you interact, reflect, and engage.
* **Merge Mechanism**: Once matched, your roadmaps fuse. You share reminders, quests, and check-ins. You move forward together, like two parts of the same story.
* **XP & Gamified Accountability**: Each action builds trust. Engagement shouldn't just be rewarded—it should be remembered.

### What buddy.me is trying to solve

1. **Loneliness in self-improvement**: Most goal-tracking apps are solitary. We’re social by design.
2. **Lack of accountability**: Deadlines don’t motivate people—people motivate people.
3. **Flaky social features**: Other apps match you on interest. We match you on intent, behavior, and alignment.

> Infer user intent, character, and matchability based on how they interact with roadmap structures, not what they explicitly say. We want to answer: “Given a set of roadmap paths a user has taken, what can we infer about them—and who should they be paired with?”

### What buddy.me believe's in

Connection isn’t built by asking you to list what you like. It’s built by observing how you move through life—and pairing you with someone moving the same way.

When you say, *“Hey, you look beautiful today,”* you’re not just trying to connect with someone—you’re trying to connect with yourself. Buddy.me wants to nurture both.
