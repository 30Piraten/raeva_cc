For me, design begins with a pen and paper, nothing more. If I can sketch it and compose a string of sentences that give it breadth, then I have fulfilled the first layer of what design means to me. 
There are no colors, 2×2 pixel grids, or glossy UI tricks. Because design, at its core, is plain and die-hard simple. But what makes a user feel they have come to the right place? What gives a product that click—that sense of fit? 

One might think it is the UI, but UI is not design—it is just a layer. You can have the most beautiful UI and still fail on the backend. I like to do both, or at least try to understand both. 
I am not just a designer or solely a backend engineer. I start with an idea and try to bring that to life with cherry-picked resources that help me work fast and light. All for one purpose—or at the very least, to solve a real pain point and maybe build something that lasts.

Design is not what is shiny and the buzz of the week. It is a concept wrapped in clarity and driven by need. Ultimately, it is about understanding the user's goal. In short, design is Apple + IDEO + systems thinking. Built with intention, measured with empathy, and delivered with care.

For each design, I commit myself to—components, a flow, or a Product. I revert back to the basics and ask: What does the user want to see, and how do I bring that to life—simply, clearly—while solving their pain? This is what design means to me. Nothing else.
